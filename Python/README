I made Machine Learning course's exercise from Coursera in Python 

These codes require the following libraries:

1- Numpy (http://www.numpy.org), for matrix and array manipulations

2- Scipy (http://www.scipy.org), used mainly on optimization / minimization functions

3- Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org), for plotting

4- NLTK (http://www.nltk.org), mainly for preprocessing text in spam detection section

5- Sci-Kit Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), used for the SVM section. This is a great machine learning library
